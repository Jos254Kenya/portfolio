- Back in 2017, when I was joining the University, I had no idea what or how to use a computer felt like.
I had no interest either in knowing it, or coming across to use one. All I trusted was my mobile phone (android 4.4.1)
That was really cool from my perspective in life. 
And, then, boom, there was a first unit in my course that sounded like 'Introduction to IT' whaat! that really got me unaware.
But, still, at least i could tell myself, "i will use those things in the labs". But things got more serious than that!
Until one day I found myself requesting for a laptop ...
....
I have progressed from that point, and came to fall in real Love with IT, I immediately decided to follow youtube channels for windows form applications development in C#
ALL THE WAY up to when I joined ALX, i have done a tremendeous progress and achieved several milestones....

an extra mile in earning it. But things turned out to be really "Hard things." 
I anticipated to find PHP,(plenty of it) but that has not been the case. 
iI foound myselft struggling to understand Python, after realizing that I had to make this page (Portfolio) in python!
I strambled here and there, serving more than one master, (side hustle job, casual jobs and ALX). 
This has been the biggest challenges I have had so far. and so I might not have mastered all the techs but ALX has offered me MORE THAN I COULD IMAGINE

- Just like the vision I had while joining ALX, I am goin to make my best out of this too.
- With the current progress, there will be other changes, from suggestions and bugs (if there may be)

I would say, I give myself a 9/10 for this progress.
Because, It has been toughm starting from scratch but still had to make it count, given the limited time I had.
By the end of the timeline (deadline on MVP), this project would have reached a tramendeous stage, and would be out for the would to see.
